- how to create internal cross-referncing between sections?

- how to embed references to papers?

- change Land and Scape to Landscape and Layer, if I change that in the package

- should "2d Numpy array" instead by "2d `numpy.ndarray`"?

- figure out how to replace the `<...>` markup with something that will make those words come out nicer (like code, rather than just italics)
